## Background

### _Current Situation in Indonesia_
MSMEs, which contribute only 15.7% to exports, hold substantial growth potential given their 61% contribution to GDP and employment of 96.9% of the workforce, supported by competitive pricing and high-quality products, alongside effective natural resource management.

### _Global Market Context_
By linking Indonesian exporters with international buyers, we can capitalize on substantial global opportunities, leveraging Indonesia's competitive pricing and high product quality to gain significant advantages in the international market.
